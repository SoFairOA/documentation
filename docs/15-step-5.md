# Step 5 Validation of software mentions

## Context

Once enabled in the CORE Dashboard, the notifications will be sent to the repository endpoint via the XXXX protocol. When a notification is received by the repository, the repository will forward the information to the named author for validation. This will take place via email, however contact with authors will be managed by the repository. 

**The trigger:** 

## Action

### 5.1 OA send mention validation request

The OA sends an email notification to the author using the `<author_email>` in the OA database with the elements from step 4, following one of the email request templates in [templates](https://github.com/SoFairOA/documentation/tree/main/docs/templates).

### 5.2 Management of author responses

There can be a number of distinct responses from the author at this stage; 

* 5.2.1 Validation details are fully correct, all fields are correctly populated, the link to the software repository is valid. ðŸŸ¢
* 5.2.2 Validation details are only partially correct, fields are not correctly populated or the link to the software repository is not valid. ðŸŸ¡
    * When partially correct, the author insert correct elements in the specific fields on a dedicated form proposed by the OA
* 5.2.3 Validation details are not correct, the software mention has been mis-identified or mis-extracted and cannot be validated. ðŸ”´
    * An important case to keep track of in a list at OA and in CORE so that the author isnâ€™t asked again for the same software name
    * The risk of having only two options is to have the authors swamped with validation requested without the possibility to reject

    update_request --> validated
    request_sent --> rejected
    request_sent --> validated
    validated --> [*]
```

To avoid overloading authors with requests which may lead to them being ignored, only one validation request should be attempted per manuscript. 

The validation request will only take place once a new software asset has been identified. This stage is however dependent on the successful implementation of the disambiguation of software assets in 3.2.2.

Once validated, the asset registration process begins.
