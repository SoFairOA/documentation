# Scope

Develop a **machine learning assisted workflow for software assets lifecycle**
covering all the steps from 1) **identification of software mentions** in
research manuscripts, 2) their **validation** by authors, 3) their
**registration with PIDs** and **archival** if needed.

In this documentation, we will cover the technical steps needed to implement
the workflow using existing protocols and infrastructures.

The infrastructures, tools and protocols used in this documentation are:

* Infrastructures
    * CORE[^1]
    * HAL[^2]
    * Software Heritage[^3]
* Tools
    * GROBID / Softcite[^4]
* Protocols
    * SWORD v2[^5]
    * OAI-PMH[^6]
